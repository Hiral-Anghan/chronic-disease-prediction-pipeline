### Research Question 1 (RQ1)
**How do data quality issues affect model accuracy?**

We implemented an end-to-end Airflow pipeline that:
1. Ingests raw EMR-style heart disease data
2. Cleans missing values, duplicates, and outliers
3. Analyzes data quality issues visually and statistically
4. Trains Logistic Regression and Random Forest models
5. Compares model performance before and after cleaning

Results show consistent improvement in accuracy and F1-score
after data cleaning, demonstrating the critical impact of
data quality on predictive performance.
